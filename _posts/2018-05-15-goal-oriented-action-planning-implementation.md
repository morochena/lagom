Note: I decided to use JS for this example because it's ubiquitous and easy to translate into other languages. While this is a functional GOAP implementation, I must warn you that it's fairly naive, especially in terms of how the agents sense the world. A better implementation (in C#) is [ReGoap](https://github.com/luxkun/ReGoap) so if you're looking to use GOAP in production I would start there. [GPGOAP](https://github.com/stolk/GPGOAP) is another great example.



Lastly, I would like to say that this is just my interpretation of GOAP. If you're interested in the source behind these ideas please check out Jeff Orkin's article [here](http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~jorkin/gdc2006_orkin_jeff_fear.pdf).
